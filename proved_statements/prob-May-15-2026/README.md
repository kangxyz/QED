## Problems

### P1 — Return probability asymptotics for lamplighter walk on $\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr T_d$

Let $d \ge 3$, let $T_d$ be the infinite $d$-regular tree. Consider the usual switch–walk–switch lamplighter random walk on the lamplighter graph $\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr T_d$ and let $p_n(x,y)$ denote its $n$-step transition probability. Then, as $n \to \infty$,
$$p_{2n}(e,e) = \rho_d^{2n} \exp\!\left[-\bigl(\pi^2(\log(d-1))^2 + o(1)\bigr)\frac{n}{\log^2 n}\right],$$
where
$$\rho_d = \frac{2\sqrt{d-1}}{d}.$$

### P2 — Total variation asymptotics for switch-walk-switch on $\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{Z}$

Let $P_t^x$ denote the law at time $t$ of the discrete-time switch-walk-switch walk on $\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{Z}$. For $x = (\mathbf{0}, 0)$ and $y = (\mathbf{0}, 2)$, one has the asymptotic behavior
$$\|P_t^x - P_t^y\|_{\mathrm{TV}} \asymp t^{-1/2},$$
where $\asymp$ denotes equality up to positive multiplicative constants.

## Expert Comments from Minghao Pan

1. We evaluate QED on two research-level open questions in probability theory. Without human mathematical input beyond the problem statements, QED generated correct proofs for both questions through multiple rounds of refinement, including substantial changes of proof plan by the decomposition agent.

2. The first result (P1) is a solid specialized contribution. Its proof has real mathematical content as it cleverly combines probabilistic constructions with spectral analysis. Its significance appears comparable to work suitable for venues such as the *Electronic Journal of Probability* or *Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society*.

3. The second question (P2) is a technically nontrivial PhD-level problem.

4. Both questions are in the style of precise probabilistic calculations and estimates.
